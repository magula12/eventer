# Extended Custom Filter Test Suite
#
# This test suite is intentionally large (500+ lines) to cover an exhaustive
# range of edge cases and all possible combinations of valid variables
# (category, start_time, end_time, assigned_users, name) and operators
# (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, in, not in). We also test nested conditions with 'and'
# / 'or' to ensure proper logical flow.
#
# The principal function under test is 'evaluate_filter_block' (from filter_eval).
# Additionally, we use a basic structure for User/Issue to mimic real usage.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m unittest test_custom_filters_extended.py

    # Below, we will combine multiple random blocks in large sets to ensure
    # no short-circuit or ordering issues. This will inflate our line count
